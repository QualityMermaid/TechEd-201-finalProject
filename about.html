            <h3>Jessica Bane</h3>
            <p>
                Jessica came up with this idea after spending many hours with her son making up bedtime stories. Having a 'cheat sheet' of ideas for how the story would progress as well as adding in things she wanted her son to know. eg. bedtime is 7pm
            </p>
            <p>
                Her son would usually request things like "Story about Itsy Spider and a Volcano" or "Itsy and the Tornado". Using a format can help limit scope of some stories and can be a fun thing for both child and parent as they select and fill in things they want to have within the story. Which can lead to less crying of 'not that one' as the child has had some say of the contence of the story.
